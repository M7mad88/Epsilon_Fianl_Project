Bank_Marketing_Classification Problem
OBJECTIVE: This Business problem uses data related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed ('yes') or not ('no').
